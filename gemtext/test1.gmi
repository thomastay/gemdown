# Hello!

This is just regular markdown

But it can be converted into gemini text!

* thing 1
* thing 2

* thing 3
* thing 4

```js
function thisIsInABlockQuote() {
  return "Hello, world\n!";
}
```

I can also have inline links [2] and it works fine.

Image links are ok too:  but they go on a new line.

Footnotes are also fine! [note 1]


If you [forgot to close a [ bracket, thats fine as long] as it's not a link

# References
=> https://example.com 2. my_link

# Footnotes
1) I am the note
