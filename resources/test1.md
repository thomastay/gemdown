# Hello!

This is just regular markdown

But it can be converted into gemini text!

- thing 1
- thing 2

* thing 3
* thing 4

```js
function thisIsInABlockQuote() {
  return "Hello, world\n!";
}
```

I can also have inline links [my_link](https://example.com) and it works fine.

Image links are ok too: ![img] (https://example.com/image.jpg) but they go on a new line.

Footnotes are also fine! [^1]

[^1]: I am the note

If you [forgot to close a [ bracket, thats fine as long] as it's not a link
